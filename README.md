# Getting Started 

## Don't know anything about GitHub? 
It's Easy. Hit the "Clone or Download" button on the upper right corner, and download it as a ZIP file. 

## Familiar with GitHub?
- You can clone the repository
- Or just bookmark it:  click the Star button to save it in your stared repos
- If you want to receive notifications on changes that are made, click Watch. You can follow it on your Github newsfeed, and even receive email notifications.
- If you want a copy where you can make changes or additions, then Fork it. You can then make your changes and then submit a pull request if needed. I'll be happy to merge it with mine!
